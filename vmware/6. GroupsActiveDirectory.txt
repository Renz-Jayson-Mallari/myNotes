Creating and Administering Groups in Active Directory on Windows Server 2012

Why Active Directory?
	--> makes it easier to administered security and permissions for Users and Computers on the network.
	
Why we create a Domain Controller?
	-->  on the domain controller we can somebody else password, create a user account, create a computer account so on and so fort
	--> we dont want to seat down at each individual computer in order to create a user account stuff.
	
Why Groups?
	--> make administrating the network easier because what you can do is you can put users , computers and even other groups 
	into a single group and then assign permissions or security policies to the group.
	
Permissions?
	--> the users or computer ability access networ resources, and what they able to do with the network resources.
	Are they able to see them, able to read or write, Access a share folder in the network. Are they be a ble to a 
	access a shared file in the network, are they be able to edit that shared file. Are they be able to access a printer
	in the network. 
	--> been able to access and interact with network shared resources.
	
Security?
	--> is what users able to do with their systems.
	--> Are they able to access the control panel.
	--> Are they able to change the background settings.
	--> Are they able to do different types of thing to computer.
	
NOTES: Permissions are being able to access shared resources on the network while security actually is been able to do stuff
to the computer itself.
