Introduction to File and Share Permissions in Windows Server 2012

2 different types of permissions
1. File or share permissions
	--> are persmissions that are coming to play when you share resources 
	like files, folders and printers over the network
2. NTFS persmissions
	--> are always on effect
	--> ex. if you try to access files,folders and printers permission are always on effect.
	--> when you sit down on local computer on a network the permission is always on effect.
	
NOTES: 
		--> always assign permission and security into a group and not to inidividual users so that 
	it will be more flexible incase of future expansions.
		--> Also in terms of applying changes instead of changin permissions on each individual computer 
	you rather makes the change in a group and it will be apply to all the computer that is member of the
	group where that changes is applied.
		--> A group of one is a better idea than assigning permissions on a specifiec user.
		
IN Terms the user is a member of MULTIPLE GROUPS
	--> permission is allowing user to access share resources.
	--> the ability (ex read, write and and list) is cumulative.
		ex. >> marketing department has READ permission to a FOLDER
			>> bookeeping department has a WRITE permision to the same FOLDER
			>> then the USER that is a member of bothe marketing and bookeeping departing
			his permision is cumulative and therefore he has a read and write permision of the FOLDER
			
OWNER
	--> the owner of a folder can assign permisions to other users.
	
Administrator
	--> has the ability to take ownership of any folder that is created in the network.
	then he can assign the permission to that folder to the groups.
	
When to use share permissions?
	--> assigning the share permissions, this is what actually shares the file, folder or resources out to the network.
	So if you give file, folder , resource NTFS permission only, NO body else from the network can be able to access it.
	because it hasnt been shared. The very act of giving share permission into a file,folder,resource is to actually 
	shares it into the network.
	
NOTE: for SHARE Permissions >> you are going to use it to share file,folder,resource over the network.
							>> to make your life easier is give everyone the GROUp the permision to read and write to the FOLDER
							>> if you give the read/write permission to a folder then you will going to run into conflicts
							between shares permissions and NTFS permissions.
							
GENERAL
	1. used share permisions to share out file,folder,resource.
	2. give EVERYONE Group the ability to read/write permision.
	3. ONly used NTFS permisions to give or restrict access to those resources.
	

AT Windows Server STEPS.
1. Server manager
2. tools "Active Directory Users and Computers"
3. Users FOLDER
ex.
4. Employees Group double click
>> Members
	> test Users
	> user2
5. Bad Group double click
>>Members
	> user2
	
6. file explorer >> Computer >> C: drive >>
7. Create a folder called "Share"
	>> rigthclick
	>> properties
	>> Sharing tab
	>> click "share" button
	>> type everyone group
	>> give read/write permmsions
		everyone has read/write permission
		
8. Create Private and Public folder inside the Share folder.
	>> rightclick on Private
	>> properties
	>> Security
	>> Edit
	>> Eployees group Allow everything
	>> Bad group Deny all permisions.
	
	Changing Ownership
	>> Advanced  tab
	>> Owner : change
	>> type the new Owner name ok
	
Enable/Disable Inheritance
	--> the inner folder will inherit the same permissions of the parent folder
	
	>> rightclick on Public
	>> properties
	>> security
	>>
	
On the workstation 
>> login as test user "the good user"
>> search
>> UNC --> Universal Naming Convention "\\server"
	   --> server is the name of the server
	   --> in order to access the share file on the server you do \\ and the name of the server
	   
>> doubleclick on share folder
>> now you can see private and public folder.
>> full access
>> signout

>> login as the user2 "the bad employee" to show the restriction.
>> same steps
>> now we can only see the public folder.
>> full access

NOTES: Evertime you make any modifications, either permissions or security. Many times those changes do not coming
to affect until the users has logoff and log back in
