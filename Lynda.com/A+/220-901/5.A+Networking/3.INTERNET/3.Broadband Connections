Broadband COnnections

3 major types of broadband
1. dsl --> Digital Subscriber Line
	   --> telephone line or rj11 for connection (input)
	   --> rj45 for output
	   --> some box for connectivity of input and output.
	   --> smallest or slowest among the broadband.
	   --> upload speed is small percentage of the download speed.
	   
	   PPPOE --> point to point protocol over internet
			 --> need to type in user name and pw
			 
	
2. cable  --> cable is lot faster than dsl
		  --> coax connection (input)
		  --> rj45 for output
		  --> some box for connectivity of input and output.
		  
3. fiber --> fiber optic connection cable (input)
		 --> rj45 for output
		 --> some box for connectivity of input and output.
		 
	NOTE : DSL people didnt like to being totally upsurped by cable and as a result
		they came out with the competito cable called fiber.
		
	2 major competitor of fiber her in USA
	1. FIOS --> Verizon
	2. U-verse --> AT&T
	
	NOTES: This a really DSL connection but they are extremely high speed DSL so you cant use 
	your phonelines 
	
	NOTES: >> DSL is the slowest broadband connection and it connects to a phone line.
		   >> Cable is the next fast broadband connection and it uses coaxial cable.
		   >> fiber-optic cable is the fastest broadband connection and it uses fiber-optic cabling.
