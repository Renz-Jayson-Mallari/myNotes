Wireless problems scenarios

1. Interference -->

>> Open up resource monitor --> search resource monitor on windows
	>> it will only show that the speed is running at 1mbps or less. Well
	
	8084085627
	47
	
>> Go to Network Sharing on Control Panel>> Network and Internet>> Network and Sharing Center >> 
	>> Click the wifi name
	>> now it will show the max Speed which is
		Speed : 65Mbps
		
	Notes if the speed listed is seems lower than usual, it mostly a interference issue
	Solution: kill the interference and run away from it.
		>> killing the interference example > get rid of baby monitor
											> find a baby monitor that runs on different bands 
		>> run away from it > manually set the channel for your wireless access point to something
							a little bit further away from everybody else.

	Use Windows utility to check wireless speed
	
2. Other big issue that comes ALL the TIME
	>> is when you log in to the new network 
	>> its says that youre connected but you cant get to the internet.
	
	Resolution.
	1. Check your ip address
		> ipconfig /all
			> if you have 169.254.X.X(APIPA address)
			> this means that you type in a wrong password
				>> dont use a wrong WAP password
				
3. You been working on particular network and suddenly you cant get on 
		
		> site survey >> wifi dropdown
		> connection itself >> rightclick and properties 
		
	NOTES : > Interference can disrupt or slow wireless connections
			> sourece of interference can include other WAPs, wireless mice and keyboards, and
			micorwabes.
			> remove sources of interference or change the WAP's frequncy to avoid interference.
