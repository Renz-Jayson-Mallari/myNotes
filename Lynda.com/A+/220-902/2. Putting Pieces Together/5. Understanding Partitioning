Understanding Partitioning

2. Mounting

> All drives have at least one partition.

> 2 different types of Partitioning
	
	1. MBR - Master Boot Record
		   - 1980's
		   - consist of 2 big pieces
				1. boot loader
				2. partition table
		   - maximum of 4 partitions
				1. where the partition starts
				2. where the patition ends
				3. what kind of partition (information in the partition)
		   - it couldnt support a single patition bigger than two terabytes.
	
	NOTES >> primary partition - simply mean I can put an OS on it. 
		  >> boot loader - tiny little bit of code and hes at that very specific spot at LBA0 
	      >> Active partition - to tell the system on which partition to go to find the OS.
		   
		   
	2. GPT - GUID Partition Table
		   - consist of 
				1. protective MBR
				2. Primary GPT header - GPT bootloader
				3. after that are all the diff. GUID paritition entries
				   - the GPT can have unlimited entry.
				4. Secondary GPT Header - end of the drive 
				                        - backup copy (repair system that have corrupted table.)
											
	>> Review >> MBA was the original PC Partitioning System.
			  >> MBA is limited to (2TB) primary partitions.
			  >> GPT is the MBA's replacement and supports much bigger, and many more partitions than MBA.
