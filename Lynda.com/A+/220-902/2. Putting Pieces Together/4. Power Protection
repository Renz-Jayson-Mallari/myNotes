Power Protection

Issues

> Power Spikes and Suage - when we have more voltage than we suppose to have.
						 - so we go way past 120 voltz.
						 
> Power Sags and Brownouts - is when we dont have enough voltage, and then overtime we start to see 
						   where we dont get up to 120 and as a result of that, we can a problem  with 
						   that as well.
						   
Solution - Use surge suppressors

Surge Suppressors - the idea, if you had a choice between getting a spike or a sag, you always  want to have a sag.
				  - spike will destroy stuff, sags will just turn thing OFF.
				  - so we use surge suppressors to eliminate spikes.
				  
UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply)
	- nothing more than a surge suppressors with a built in motorcycle battery  on most of these.
	- surge suppressors is meassure in joule, a joules is a Watt / second.
	- a little UPS like this is probably gonna be about 2000  joules, that mean it can provide 2000 watts/second.
	- in reality your system only using a couple of 100 watts at any given moment.
