Dynamic Disk

	> Predate GPT, but come after MBR
	> we still use dynamic disk even on the most modern system.
	
	Disk Management 
	> on the left under Disk 2, it says Basic.
	> When you see basic on this Microsoft windows, that means this disk is NOT dynamic.
	It just using the regular partition table, be it MBR or GPT.
	> TO convert from basic to Dynamic
		> right click on it > Convert to Dynamic disk. > It will ask which disk( ex. Disk 2) 
		> Try
			> make a simple volumes > microsoft says the limitations says around 2,000 volumes.
			> Dynamic disk will give us a different color for simple volume.
		
		> You can Expand and Shrink volumes with Basic disks.
		Steps
		> right click > shrink > ok (for quick shrink)
		> right click > extend > ok /next ( will extend for the rest of the hard drive).
		
		> Spanning
			> it needs more than one drive.
		Steps
		> right click > spanned volume > select the drive > add > next > perform a quick format(check) > Finish
			--> The operation you selected will convert the basic disk to dynamic, do you want to continue? > Yes
		> spanned volumes is on purple bar
		> ex. each of this has 1.8TB drives disk management
		> both have the drive letter H
		> on windows/ file explorer the H drive has 3.63TB
		> we are taking two drives and making it look, act , bark, taste like one greatbig volume. 
		
		> Risky 
		> what will do is start filling up the first drive, and its not until that first drive get full 
		that the second spanned drive actually comes into play. If you loose either drive, youve lost everything.
		
		NOTE > Like Raid 0, Spanned drive are not fault tolerant.
		
		>Downside
		> Once you convert a drive to dynamic, the only way you can convert it back to basic is to wipe all the volumes.
		> right click > delete volumes > yes ( Deleted volumes
		> right click > convert to dynamic disk.
		
		Review >> Volumes can Shrink or Extend within a disk on Basic disk
				>> Spanning drives requires dynamic disks
				>> Spanning offers no fault tolerance.
