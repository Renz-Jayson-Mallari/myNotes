MBR - Master Boot Record
	- Maximum of 4 partitions
	
	>> Goto Disk Management
	>> Unallocated - not setup in any way shape or form
	>> regular volumes or simple volumes
		steps MBR
			>> right click on unallocated >> new simple volumes
			>>next >> leave a max >> D >> leave a default NTFS format>> Finish
			>> created a whole drive as one whole partition called D.
			
			>> right click >>> new simple volumes >> next
			>> half of the volume example(1000000) >>  D >> leave a default NTFS format>> Finish
			>> created half of the hdd as partition called D.
			>> partition the rest of the drive >> same process
			>> created half of the hdd as partition called E.
			
			>> 4 partition >> hdd devided into 4
			>> Extended Partition and Logical Drive
			>> the last partition will be call extended partition which can be devided to pass more than 4 partiition.
			>> 3 primary and the last 1 is extended partitions
			
			>> maximum of 2TB
			>> if you put a bigger than 2TB, the HDD size will be devided as 1 unallocated space has maximum of 2TB
			
		steps Partitioning with GTP
			>> GUID Partition Table
			>> Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)
			>> open up regedit
			>> 128 bits long
			>> 32 hexadecimal character 32 hexadecimal characters
			
			>> right click on the left side where the disk number is (ex Disk 1)
			>> Convert GPT Disk
			>> the devided MBR will be 1 GPT 3.7TB unallocated space
			>> can have larger that 2TB
			>> new Simple Volume >> next >> max >> quick format default NTFS >> 
			
			>> 4 partitions >> same steps 
			>> now they are all primary partiitons
			>> can handle about thousands different partitions.
			>> although most operating systems are limited  to about 128 partitions
			
	
	>> Deleting volume is permanent, what ever is on partition when you deleted it will not be recovered.
			>> right click >> delete volumes
			
			
	>> Review >> MBA Partitions types: Primary and Extended
			  >> Extended Parttions hold Logical Drives
			  >> GPT allows volumes greater than 2TB and up to 128 volumes per disk
