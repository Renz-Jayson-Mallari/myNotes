Storage Space

	> Implementing RAID
	> Traditional 2 choices
	  1. Hardware RAID - almost all mobo comes with built in RAID
	  2. Software RAID - within Windows, like striping and mirroring
	
	> This versions of RAID are very static(fixed), once you set them up you cant really make any changes of them at all.
	
	Storage Spaces came out with windows 8
	
	Storage Spaces Windows 10 
	> goto Disk Management
	> 5 hard drives
	> disk 1 disappear as it added to the pool on Storage spaces
	
	> goto Control Panel to Open up Storage Spaces
	> create a pool ( minimum 1 to a lot of drives)
	> then decide what kind of RAID do you want
	> add 1 drive initially
	> disk will disappear from disk management
	
	4 kinds of Resiliency
	1. Simple > JBOD
			  > Just a bunch of disk
			  
	2. Two way mirror > pretty close to classic RAID 1 mirror
					  > minimum of 2 drives
					  > whatever you put on one drive, you put it on the other.
					  
	3. Three way mirror > same as RAID 6
						> minimum of 5 drives
						> you can loose up to 2 drives before you loose your data.
						
	4. Parity > RAID 5
			  > minimum of 3 drives
			 
	NOTES >> you cant use boot drive on Storage Spaces.
	
	Thin Provisioning > virtualize this pool
					  > you can broadcast that you have 10TB from 1.8TB HD
					  > once you almost use the 1.8TB you will get notify
					  > you can add a HDD and continue to use it.
					  
	> create new pool
	> put all 5 drives
	> create pool
