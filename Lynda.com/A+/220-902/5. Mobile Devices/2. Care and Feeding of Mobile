 - make sure your phone wifi os the same 802.11 standard and band as your wap.

 3. Wireless mobile connection part 2
 
	hotspot - makes phone act like a wap with cellular network connection.
	
		- multiple stations can connect to the hot spot via wifi.
		
		
	Tethering - uses a wired connection between the phone and the computer - typically usb
			- because tethering is wired, it is difficult to hack.
			- the connection makes the link appear as network connection.
			
			
	Mobile payment services use 
	NFC - Near Field Communication.
	NFC has slow transfer speed(424 kb/s)
	
	NFC can be enabled/disabled called android beam on android device.
	
	NFC printing uses nfc to start the process,
	then starts wifi direct.
	
	Wifi direct creates a temporary ad-hoc network between nfc devices.
	
 Infrared - most android devices have an infrared interface(ir)
