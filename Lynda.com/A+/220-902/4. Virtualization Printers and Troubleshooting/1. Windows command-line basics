 directory means folder

Review - Access the command line though the starmenu
	launch it in admin mode only when commands need it
	
		- Use the DIR command to show whats in a directory
		use the cd command to move to a new directory
		
		
		- Use switches to use different options on commands
		dont forget, you can always use /? to get help
