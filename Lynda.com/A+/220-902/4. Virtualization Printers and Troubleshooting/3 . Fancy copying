Fancy copying

	XCOPY
	 - copies files and folder
	 
	 > xcopy *.* d: /s /e
	 xcopy /s - copies current and populated subdirectories
	 xcopy /e - copies empty directories
	 
	 ROBOCOPY
	 - much much faster
	 - more robust
	 - its so robust its name is short for robust copying
	 
	 > robocopy .\documents d: /e /s
	 documents is folder inside the current folder
	 ex. renz\documents when renz is the current folder
	 
	 review
	 
	 > xcopy is the classic command for copying a directory with all its files.
	 > use the /s and /e with xcopy to get both populated and empty subdirectories
	 > robust file copy(robocopy) is like a turbochrged xcopy
	 use /s and /e if you want to use it like xcopy.
