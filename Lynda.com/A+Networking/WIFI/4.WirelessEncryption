Wireless Encryption

1. WEP --> Wired Equivalent Privacy
	   --> can be cracked in 5mins
	   --> 64 bits but can only use 40bits or 10characters password
	   
	   
2. WPA --> Wireless (WI-FI) Protected Access
	   --> same as 802.11i except the aes encryption
	   --> downside is it can be cracked
	   --> can be cracked about an hour or so
	   
3. WPA2 --> Wireless (WI-FI) Protected Access 2
		--> it is extremely difficult to cracked a WPA2 network
		
	difference between wpa and wpa2 is wpa2 has turned on aes
	
	NOTE: WEP is very insecure -- DONT use it, WPA2 is the strongest wi-fi encryption --use it
